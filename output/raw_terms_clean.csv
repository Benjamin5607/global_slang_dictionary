"annapolis","""A drinking town with a sailing problem."" Home of The [United States Naval Academy], AKA hot mids. We wear flip-flops year-round, and khakis and a nice shirt is considered ""dressed up."" [Everything] is laid-back and casual, rednecks aren't welcome, and we eat [everything] with Old Bay. We love to make fun of Plebes and tourists. [Everyone knows that] the movie ""Annapolis"" was totally fake. Broadneck can kick Severna Park's ass any day. Beer pong is a must. If you don't play lax in middle and high school, you might as well turn around and go back to wherever you came from. I bet you half your school will get early dismissal when [the Blue Angels] fly. You are nobody if the guy at Bay 50 doesn't know your name. We love O'Laughlin's and Starbucks. The mall is our second home. You can find most of the town at [Battle Of The Bands]. First Night is a MUST. We dress like preps, jocks, or gangsters, but usually a combination of all three. We like our guys hot and our beer cold. I'm from Annapolis; you name it, I'm better at it than you.  Annapolis, AKA Naptown, is in Anne Arundel County. It has a [comfortable] balance of preps and gangsters. Historic Annapolis has a lovely collection of coveted waterfront properties, as well as a ghetto. Annapolis is within 40 minutes of Baltimore, DC, PG County, and Maryland's Eastern Shore (but who the fuck would ever want to go THERE?). The Annapolis Mall is gangsterrr, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  THE PREPPY SiDE Most preps reside in Severna Park and are known as ""parkies."" Everyone from Mago Vista to the Broadneck Peninsula hates them and knows they're stuck up as hell. Severna Park High School is considered to be ""the good school."" They're snobby about [everything]...academics, sports, band...you name it! But they really suck!! Severna Park is not in Annapolis! It's in Arnold. But Parkies think they live in Naptown.  THE BR0ADNECK PENiNSULA Starts where AAC starts (at Sandy Point, when you come over the Bay Bridge) and ends around Mago Vista. A mix of people. Everyone was happy when Melvin was found (2006)! People walk to Graul's in their PJs, and kids in Revell Downs (home!) are always up in the [7/11]. Breakneck is the local band. Most Broadneck Peninsula kids go to Severn or Fagothy Middle, then onto Broadneck High. The girls are hot and the guys are chill at Broadneck. It is THE place to be. PS. Note to all PG County dumbasses who come to Sandy Point to swim: IT IS NOT A BEACH. YOU CAN'T SWIM THERE. Idiots. PSS. Note to all tourists who keep driving through on College Parkway to get to the toll booths: YOU CAN'T COME THIS WAY. TAKE 50. Retarrrds.  HiST0RiC ANNAP0LiS A swarm of hot mids and clueless tourists holding ice cream cones. Downtown Annapolis is amazing ...always sunny and gorgeous during the summer. There is an unlimited supply of coffee shops and ice cream stores. It's fun to go watch random peoples' weddings. Ghettos include, but are not limited to: RobinWood, Bywater I && II, Clay Street, [Presidents Street], and some parts of Browns Woods. The Annapolis High School district has the ghettoest schools in AAC, so be prepared! PS. Note to tourists: PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE DUCKS.
