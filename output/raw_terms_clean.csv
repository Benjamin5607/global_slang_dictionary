"Nave","adj., n., v.  ""Nave"" can take on the meanings of many different words, and can be used in a number of situations. It is derived from the word ""naïve,"" and can be used synonymously with it, but its meaning has expanded to become more general and can sometimes be used positively.  Although chiefly an adjective, ""nave"" can be used as both a verb and a noun. For example, the phrase ""Claude is going to nave Elizabeth in this [spelling bee]"" would mean that Claude is going to make a fool of Elizabeth, and the phrase ""Manpreet is a complete nave"" would mean that Manpreet is a foolish person.  From ""nave,"" many other words have been derived, such as ""naved,"" ""navest,"" ""naving"" and ""naver."" It has also spawned a number of phrases known as ""navisms,"" for example, a ""nave cave"" is the vaginal tract of a slut or [prostitute]; ""the abolishment of the nave trade"" describes an event where a person has been very badly murked; to ""misbenave"" is to behave badly, but in a humorous or impressive way, and so forth.  Despite these [definitions], ""nave"" is a very flexible word and its [use] is largely left to the speaker's discretion. Combining the meanings of many [contemporary] words in the modern teenager's [vocabulary] such as ""gay,"" ""retarded,"" ""pwn,"" ""murk,"" ""gash,"" ""sick,"" ""badass"" and literally dozens more, ""nave"" is an essential tool in today's fast-paced, urban world; the Swiss-army knife of the teenage lexicon.","UrbanDictionary","en","US","nave"
